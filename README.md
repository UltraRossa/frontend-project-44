## About

* **brain-calc**
    + *Have you ever dreamed to be a calculator? No?! You have a great opportunity to know what it's to be! Add, substract or multiply given numbers!*
* **brain-gcd**
    + *This game is hard enough. Find the greatest common divisor of given numbers by yourlsef or use online-services just like I did!*
* **brain-prime**
    + *Have you watched Transformers movie? There was one big chief-robot called Optimus Prime. In this game you need to decide if the given number is prime or not.*
* **brain-progression**
    + *In this game you need to find the missing number of the progression. I can poudly say that this game is the only one I passed myself without any help. If I did it You'll certainly do it! Good luck!*
